        <h1>Johnny Depp</h1>
        <p><strong>Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald! </strong>What sold me on this was the dull look that Mads has during SOD.
        Johnny's Grindelwald demanded attention. Whenever he entered on the screen, you felt perplexed by his presence.
        I couldn't decide whether I supported Grindelwald in COG or not. I mean half the time I feared him other half respected him.
        SOD Grindelwald lacks the charisma and attention-demanding image that COG one had.
        Grindelwald's speech at the end COG is severely underrated.
        I am seriously disturbed by how people think Mads Grindelwald has the right idea, NO Mads and Law fit together but Johnny's Grindelwald was much more Dark Lord- like.

        <p><em>Edward Sisscorshands! </em>"Johnny Depp should have also won an Academy Award for his performance in this film. 
        Although he had very few lines in this film, less than 100, his facial expressions and actions spoke loudly. Every detail he gave his character was so perfect and precise. 
        When Edward examines the water bed, and takes his first sip of (what I'm guessing is) scotch, or in the beginning when he takes his first ride ever in a car into town. 
        Just the look on his face when he finally gets to see what the outside world looks like was pure genius." source: imdb reviewer.
